      `As a software developer, my heart definitely belongs to JavaScript.
      This language kept me aspiring every day, for more than 4 years.`,

      `In general, I like to spend my free time learning and trying out
      whatever seems reasonable.  I would even say, that learning is my
      passion. I like to watch tutorials, do small home projects, create
      responsive web apps and even I used to built gadgets with Arduino boards. When
      I look back in time, I see a pattern behind me. I prefer simple and
      clean solutions and the usefulness of the product is always my number
      one priority.`,

      `Among my personality traits, there is one, that I consider very special.
      It is a passion, or let me say some ability to ignite myself for a good
      idea. It is that one which truly pushes me forward. I believe that
      everything is learnable and possible, but it will never be awesome
      without one's spark.`,

      `I consider myself as a very happy and active person. I love life,
      people, and especially my family and I absolutely admire honesty.`,

      `At the end, I would like to mention, that work in Google was always my dream
      and I would be super happy if you would give me a chance to proove my
      professional and personal qualities.`
