      `Hi there! I am a Full-Stack Developer strongly concentrated on buiding Web Applications using JavaScript, TypeScript and Java.
      I have also experience with C with Arduino boards, Fortran with parallel computation and
      C# with collective intelligence. I am always open to something new. `,

      `In general, I like to spend my free time learning and trying out
      whatever seems reasonable.  I would even say, that learning is my
      passion. I like to watch tutorials, do small home projects, create
      responsive web apps and even I used to built gadgets with Arduino boards. When
      I look back in time, I see a pattern behind me. I prefer simple and
      clean solutions and the usefulness of the product is always my number
      one priority. Currently I keep my head bussy with with Machine learning and Neural networks with JavaScript`,

      `Among my personality traits, there is one, that I consider very special.
      It is a passion, or let me say some ability to ignite myself for a good
      idea. It is that one which truly pushes me forward. I believe that
      everything is learnable and possible, but it will never be awesome
      without one's spark.`,

      `I consider myself as a very happy and active person. I love life,
      people, and especially my family and I absolutely admire honesty.`,
