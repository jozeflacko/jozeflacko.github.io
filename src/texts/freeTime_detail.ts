          I recently changed my job and I just received a certificate from a previous employement. 
          After reading it, I was pleasantly surprised. 
          I always gave my heart to everything I did, and this letter confirms that my effort has been 
          seen and the hard work is really paying off. 
          I'd like to share this letter with you!
