      `As a software developer, my heart definitely belongs to JavaScript. 
      This language kept me aspiring every day since 2014.`,

      `In general, I like to spend my free time learning and trying out
      whatever seems reasonable.  I would even say, that learning is my
      passion. I like to watch tutorials, do small home projects, create
      responsive web apps and even I used to built gadgets with Arduino boards. When
      I look back in time, I see a pattern behind me. I prefer simple and
      clean solutions and the usefulness of the product is always my number
      one priority.`,

      `Among my personality traits, there is one, that I consider very special.
      It is a passion, or let me say some ability to ignite myself for a good
      idea. It is that one which truly pushes me forward. I believe that
      everything is learnable and possible, but it will never be awesome
      without one's spark.`,

      `I consider myself as a very happy and active person. I love life,
      people, and especially my family and I absolutely admire honesty.`,

      I would be delighted to join this huge family to prove my
      personal and professional qualities. It is a step in life, that I would like to take. `
