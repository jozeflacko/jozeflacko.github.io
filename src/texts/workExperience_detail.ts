            description: `I work at Austrian Lotteries as a Full-stack developer in a team whose main concentration is to build new architecture for development of company applications and services.
Services are written with Spring Boot, frontend is TypeScript, JavaScript & React and we use the latest standards and tools like OpenAPI Specification and OpenShift.
I am responsible for defining and implementing front-end concepts for layouting, validation, testing and maintenance. My mission is to make software which scales and is easy to understand not only for end users, but also for developers. I actively support colleagues and regularly make inhouse presentations about JavaScripts topics. Our day-to-day work is based on Scrum, where the whole team usually works on one task together.
The software we develop needs to be extensively tested, so I believe that my main success in the company has been to provide a single API for unit and end-2-end testing that made the testing process more efficient.`,

Backend was written in Java (Spring framework) and frontend in JavaScript (ES5/ES6). My main responsibilities were JavaScript development of the responsive skin of our progressive web app and significantly improving the user experience. I helped implement TypeScript and React into our codebase, which allowed us to transition from jQuery. Application contained over 350+ Uls which needed a lot of analytical and design skills. In addition, I participated in the development of a hybrid application written in Vue and Cordova. In the company I started as a full-time trainee and switched to a regular contract after 10 months. The Company won “Technology Excellence Award 2019” for innovative technology and solution quality in the categories of functional scope, usability and intuitive handling. I was also a mentor for several interns. The day-to-day work was based on Scrum, where one person usually worked on one task alone (from database, service to ui).`,

We were fully responsible for communication with the client, including to inform them of our work progress by engaging them in weekly meetings. My main responsibility in this project was front-end development.
Both projects were successfully finished and given to the client on time.`,
